        <h2>Wanna know more about me?</h2>
        <p>
            So, who am I? I honestly don't know! I really have no clue who I really am. I could think about it, I actually did a lot, but I didn't find an answer. But I could tell you what I think about, what I like, what I do, etc. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Personally, I hate almost everything, wait.. It's more like, a lot things make me uncomfortable. I don't necessary hate them, but I really hope I'm far away from them. I don't like most people. I don't like going outside, cause I'm too afraid. I hate crowds, I really really do. I stay in my room a lot, I almost never leave it. It's the only place I ever feel safe. Sometimes I get really paranoid, idk why. The outside world scares me. 
        </p>

        <p>
            But, if I need friends, I should go outside. I don't like doing that. So, I don't have many friends. I don't think I have any lmao. I almost spend most of the time, by myself. I love listening to music, It really helps. I spend most of my time, staring at a screen and listening to music. I just really love it, makes me feel comfortable. I feel like all my problems are gone and It feels like I'm in another reality, where everything is perfect. It's my drug.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's kinda the same with computers, they are my choice of sin. I really like them. In no way does that mean I'm really good with them. I just like that, even if I am not, It's okay! I can always learn. I have so much control, I can break them apart, put them together, see what's inside, change what's inside. Just learning to communicate with them opens up a world of endless possibilites. You can bring your fantasies to reality in the form of code. It's beautiful. I am able to share my thoughts with you, all because of computers. It's awesome.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, What else do I like? hmm... yeah, I love anime, energy drinks and night skies. I don't have a favourite color, but I have a preferred one, which is purple. The type of music I love is mostly not mainstream. It's more grunge/dreamcore, and I do have a few <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/mfho3h051y3owrv4vgkpfnerr?si=614176055e6b4c7a" target="_blank">playlists</a> I really like. I really don't get fazed by the sight of blood or gore. I like sci-fi and horror movies. I don't watch many rom-coms cause they make me sad. 
        </p>

        <p>
            My favourite song of all time is <a href="https://youtu.be/TmIwm5RElRs" target="_blank">I don't want to set the world on fire - The Ink Spots</a> and My preferred movie is actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_Me_by_Your_Name_(film)" target="_blank">Call me by your name</a>. I watched it so many times and I really love it. 
        </p>

        <p>
            So, now that the basics are done, let's learn a bit more about me.. lmao! so, I don't care about a lot of things. Like, I almost don't give a shit about a lot of important things. I give up almost everytime I find something difficult. I am extremly lazy and I procrastinate a lot. It's funny when people say things like <i>"how you are so good at this? you are so smart, tell me your secret, gimme a roadmap!"</i>, like, bitch idk, I have no idea how I learnt everything I know, It's all the result of many weird decisions. Honestly, It pisses me off when people call me smart, or privileged or gifted. Like, you don't know anything about me, anything about what I do or go through on a daily basis, I'm the one of the dumbest people alive, so just shut up!
        </p>

        <p>
            do have a set of rules, that I follow:<br>
            <i>  
                ->When things go bad, sleep. <br>
                ->When you get too angry, listen to music. <br>
                ->When you get too lonely or anxious, breathe slowly, drink water, listen to music and sleep. <br>
                ->Avoid talking to people as much as possible. <br>
                ->Remember, you don't have to be perfect! <br>
                ->You have a lot of issues, or flaws? It's okay! <br>
                ->Life is meaningless and existence is a curse, so It's alright to feel shitty and dead. <br>
                ->Too much noise in your head? listen to music and think about your dream!
            </i>
        </p>

        <p>
            My mind is chaotic and half the time I don't know what weird shit I say out loud. But, I know that I wouldn't act on any of my impulses and I forget almost everything I say in maybe an hour or two. Also, It maybe hard to believe, but I am a hopeless romantic. I do find marriage and love weird. I find them very weird actually, but I do believe that if I ever find <i>the one</i>, my whole perspective might change. So, yeah!
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, all this aside. In the end all I need is, to feel happy and at the end of the day, a good night's sleep. I want the noise to stop, the voices to stop and need pure silence. I don't care about making a difference, but If I am able to make atleast one person happy in my life, It will be nice. I like seeing people smile, especially the ones I love. Right now, I don't love anyone, but maybe in the future. For now, I'll stick to tech, computers and music. 
        </p>

        <p>
            So, yeah. I think I'll get back to staring at the night sky and listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqA71c85oyI" target="_blank">Be My Gf - ilyTOMMY</a>. 
        </p>

        <p>Night night!</p>
