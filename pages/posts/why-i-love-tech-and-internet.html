            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Why I'm obssessed with the Internet and Tech</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                I love technology, I really really do. Everything about it just fascinates me! It's so cool. But, why? really good question, I'll tell you all about it. <br> 
                Well, In society, everyone that loves technology or computers are labeled as nerds or geeks. If you are one and are labelled as a geek or something, don't worry, just remember, that is something people do to make them feel themselves feel superior. So, next time someone calls you a geek or something, be happy that they see you as someone way more smarter than them. so, now that basic therapy is done, let's get into why I love tech.
            </p>

            <h2>Why I love the Internet?</h2>

            <p>
                Well, It makes me feel good. Like, In case of the <b>Internet</b>, I feel at home when I'm on it. When I browse through reddit pages or any articles, and I read about people sharing their experience about a certain topic, I feel less alone. I have a beautiful thought it my head, which is "<i>ah, guess I'm not the only one!</i>". That's an awesome feeling, ngl. <br>
                I spoke to a lot of people on the internet, from different parts of the world. They shared their perspectives and I shared mine. It felt good. This is the reason why most of us love the internet, It connects us with people who understand us. <b>But, still at the end of the day, when you go offline, you are all alone, but when you are online, you feel like you are living in a dream, a dream that you wanna stay in forever.</b>

            <br>

            <p>
                It's a place of endless possibilites. Technology is just awesome. You can do so much stuff, you could build anything you imagine, you can bring your fantasies to reality. When I was a kid, I remember watching all these movies and be like, "<i>woah, so a person can build such cool stuff? can I do that? one day, even I want my own robot and me and my robot will unravel the mysteries of the universe and it'll be awesome</i>". I was so obssessed with space, stars, etc. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Later, When I started using computers, I just got obssessed. When I made my first chat bot, which was basically just a lot of print and if statements, it felt so cool. When I first saw the cmd in windows, I remember screaming "<i>I'm a hacker now!</i>". Eventhough now, I can actually use the terminal properly, I still feel the same level of excitement. It's just awesome. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I will never stop learning about tech and experiencing it. It's so beautiful and awesome. I will learn as much as possible and I believe that everyone should learn at least a bit about it. 
            </p>
